# Noter
Noter is a minimal React app which allows the user to create, edit and remove notes.

It does not require React package to be installed locally nor does it require npm server.
Simply open the index.html file and you are good to go. All the required dependencies are in 'js' folder.

**[master branch](https://github.com/MananAgarwal/Noter/tree/master)** - Run completely locally (No Internet required), but the notes are not persistent.

**[firebase-integrated branch](https://github.com/MananAgarwal/Noter/tree/firebase-integrated)** - Integrated with Firebase's RealTime Database and uses Firebase Hosting to host it [here](https://noter-28228.firebaseapp.com/)

It's written in the ES5 React Syntax.

By the way, this is my _first React App_.
